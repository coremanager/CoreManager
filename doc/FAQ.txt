Q: I'm getting this message:
  Fatal error: Call to undefined function error() in /XXXX/coremanager/libs/db_lib/mysql.php on line 46
    or
  Error - Connection to database is not established !

A: Most likely you've made a mistake in the database configuration your provided for CoreManager.
  Please note: For usernames and passwords MySQL is case sensitive.


Q: Why is the Character Sheet page incomplete or garbled?

A1: Because your Game Server isn't saving all of Character Data we need.
  For ArcEmu: Set SaveExtendedCharData to "1".
  For MaNGOS/Trinity: Set PlayerSave.Stats.MinLevel to 1.

A2: Because your Game Server doesn't store all the information CoreManager wants to display.
  For ArcEmu: You're not having this problem.
  For MaNGOS/Trinity: Get your core's dev team to add more columns to the character_stats table.


Q: Why doesn't changing the Security Level of an account make them a GM in-game?

A: Because ArcEmu, MaNGOS, and Trinity all store or use GM Levels differently,
  CoreManager uses a separate system.
  (two actually; Web Admin, which is for ACP access, is separate also)
